# Bike_buyers_Dashboard
This project analyzes a dataset of bike buyers based on their demographic and lifestyle details. The goal was to identify patterns in customer behavior and highlight factors that influence the decision to purchase a bike

#  Bike Buyers Dashboard – Excel Project  

##  Dataset used  
- <a href="https://github.com/Anshu1708/Bike_buyers_Dashboard/blob/main/First%20Excel%20Project.xlsx">Datasat</a>


## Process  
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Standardized categorical values (e.g., Married/Single, Age Brackets).  
   - Handled missing/duplicate data.  
   - Used **Excel Power Query** for cleaning and transformation.  

2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Built **Pivot Tables** to analyze relationships (e.g., income vs purchase decision, gender vs bike buying).  
   - Calculated **average income differences** between buyers and non-buyers.

##  Key Insights  
- Higher income does not always guarantee higher purchase rates.  
- **Middle-aged customers** showed more tendency to buy bikes.  
- Commute distance and region also influenced purchase behavior.  

##  Tools Used  
- MS Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboarding)

## Final Conclusion

Working on the Bike Buyers Dashboard was a great learning experience that helped me understand how raw data can be turned into meaningful insights. Using Excel, I cleaned and organized the dataset, explored customer demographics, and built an interactive dashboard to make the analysis easier to understand.

Through this project, I discovered how factors like age, income, gender, and region play an important role in whether a customer decides to purchase a bike. It was exciting to see how simple tools like Power Query, Pivot Tables, and charts can reveal such powerful stories hidden in the data.

This project reflects my ability to handle the end-to-end data analysis process – from cleaning and exploring the data to creating dashboards that support better decision-making. I see it as a strong step forward in my journey as a data analyst.
